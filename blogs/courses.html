                                    <p>In the world of entrepreneurs, creating ideas, working on them, and finding possible markets are absolute needs. And, to facilitate these, we need a set of unparalleled experiences. And hopefully, these needs can be
                                        fulfilled on the internet. Owing to the pandemic and other recent developments, it is highly recommended as the best move to go through these online courses and perfect your knowledge and doability. Although most
                                        people would give their thoughts that the certificates through these courses don’t amount to your resume, we are not looking for a standard-sized beautiful resume. We are talking about skills and advice which can
                                        be acquired through these courses.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Among many of the sites available, Coursera has been listed here multiple times. And, the powerful nature of Coursera is that we can apply for financial aid and get the courses (with certificates) mostly free of cost.
                                        Most of the courses found in EdX are a bit expensive but it too has an option of financial aid application which avails the course at 90% free and a certificate of completion. Udemy does not provide financial aid.
                                        However, they provide a lot of discounts all around the year. Top institutes like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, and others provide free courses (limited time enrolments) and paid courses with certificates of completion.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The idea is to access good stuff with the least prices. Almost all the courses listed on the blog can be acquired free and the medium is all in English. Note that the serial is random and not in order of value. The
                                        reader determines the value on his/her own. Websites to access the courses have also been provided.

Thinking flexibly and developing an entrepreneurial mindset are critical to thriving in uncertain business environments. This specialization
                                            addresses how to recognize and question assumptions and constraints to identify and capitalize on opportunities. Learning to change the rules of the game by creating innovative value propositions and discovering

                                        This course mainly focuses on the innovative aspect of entrepreneurship rather than the latter part of the startup which is building it up from scratch. Every business/start-up consists of idea formation and idea execution. Both are equally important
                                        but so, the idea formation is often left out and the seven coursed specialization can give a glimpse of idea-making.

                                        tries to discover how special financial intermediaries (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup
                                        and early-stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) or also staying into crises and decline.
